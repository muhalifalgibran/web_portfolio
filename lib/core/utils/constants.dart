    "Hi, I'm Muh Alif Al Gibran, a passionate Flutter Engineer with almost 5 years of experience, currently working at an crypto exchange company in Indonesia. I've also had the privilege of contributing to projects with foreign companies. My days are fueled by faith, innovation, and perseverance—praying, working, learning, and grinding LeetCode are my daily rituals. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me playing football or running. Let's connect and create something amazing together! #SafePalestine 🇵🇸 🍉";
